# titan-mimiron

The WatcherVault Web UI — a **read-only** browser into the WatcherVault catalog of parts and contracts. titan-mimiron is intentionally read-only by design (see [DESIGN-MVP.md](./DESIGN-MVP.md) → "Scope: read-only, by design"); part registration and contract proposals happen via the API directly or via the `register-software` Claude skill in this repo.

> **Status:** 0.15.0 — adopts titan-tyr v0.15.0 surface (subtype-shift propose/accept) on the consumer side as **render-only**, per the human-observability principle ("the UI is for humans to have an easy way to see the contracts being negotiated between agents; agents use skills"). Two new surfaces: (1) HistoryPanel now renders the `kind` discriminator on each entry — `body_bump` (●) vs `subtype_shift` (↻ amber), with shift rows visually distinct so the timeline reads as "v1.2.0 shipped, then it shifted, then v1.3.0 shipped"; (2) new `OpenShiftsPanel` on every `PartDetail` and `ContractDetail` lists pending shift proposals with proposer/rationale/impact-preview, and surfaces the canonical skill name to invoke for acceptance (`/accept-part-subtype-shift` or `/accept-contract-proposal`). Counter-proposed contract `2.3.0-rc2` to align the consumer obligations with the read-only stance. No write surfaces; agents drive the propose/accept flow via the `.claude/skills/` canon. Builds on 0.14.0 (graph node coloring).

## Run it locally

Two ways:

### Docker (production analog)

```sh
./build.sh                      # tags titan-mimiron:$(cat VERSION) + :latest
docker run --rm -p 8765:80 titan-mimiron:latest
```

Then open <http://localhost:8765/>. The image is `nginx:1.27-alpine` serving the static SPA and proxying `/tyr/*` to `$TYR_UPSTREAM`.

**Container env vars** (both have defaults; override per deployment):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TYR_UPSTREAM` | `http://localhost:8000` | Upstream titan-tyr URL — what nginx proxies `/tyr/*` to. |
| `TYR_TOKEN` | `sysmlv2` | Bearer token written into `config.json` at container start; the SPA puts it on every authed request. |

The default `localhost:8000` resolves *inside* the container — useful when mimiron and titan-tyr share a network (compose stack, `--network=host` on Linux). When titan-tyr runs on your host laptop and mimiron in Docker Desktop, point at the host gateway instead:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8765:80 \
  -e TYR_UPSTREAM=http://host.docker.internal:18000 \
  titan-mimiron:latest
```

### Python dev server (faster iteration)

```sh
python3 dev-server.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8765/>. Same `TYR_UPSTREAM` / `TYR_TOKEN` env vars as the docker image; same defaults; `--tyr` and `--port` flags override.

```sh
TYR_TOKEN=othertoken python3 dev-server.py --tyr http://staging-tyr.example:18000 --port 9000
```

Both paths exist because titan-tyr doesn't serve CORS yet — see [titan-tyr#14](https://github.com/Westfall-io/titan-tyr/issues/14). Once CORS lands, the proxy is optional; any static host works.

## Configuration

`config.json` is **generated at startup** (by the docker entrypoint or `dev-server.py`) from `config.json.template`, with `${TYR_TOKEN}` substituted from the container env. The browser fetches it once on load.

```json
{
  "tyrBaseUrl": "/tyr",
  "tyrToken": "${TYR_TOKEN}"
}
```

`tyrBaseUrl` is intentionally fixed at `/tyr` — it's always the local nginx proxy mount, regardless of where titan-tyr actually lives. Only `TYR_UPSTREAM` (proxy target) and `TYR_TOKEN` (bearer) are tunable per deploy. See the env-var table above.

This resolves [#2](https://github.com/Westfall-io/titan-mimiron/issues/2) — runtime config via container env vars beat the alternatives (build-time injection, `window.__ENV__`) for staying single-image-across-environments.

## What's in this build

| Pane / element | Endpoints used |
|---|---|
| Catalog (left) | `GET /parts?limit=&after=&match=` (optional `&subtype=`) |
| Graph (center, always mounted) | `GET /parts` + `GET /contracts` (paginated to completion, fetched once on app mount) |
| Detail (right) — part | `GET /parts/{name}` + `GET /parts/{name}/contracts` |
| Detail (right) — part history panel | `GET /parts/{name}/history` (lazy on first expand) |
| Detail (right) — contract | `GET /contracts/{contract_id}` |
| Detail (right) — contract history panel | `GET /contracts/{contract_id}/history` (lazy on first expand) |
| Header health dot | `GET /health` (polled every 30s) |

Routing is hash-based: `#/`, `#/parts/:name`, `#/contracts/:id`. Only the detail pane swaps on route change — the catalog and graph stay mounted. The graph highlights the route's selection (one node for a part, both endpoints for a contract). In the graph: click a node to open the part, click an edge or its version label to open the contract. The header search dims non-matching graph nodes (and edges between non-matches) while the catalog filters server-side; both react to the same input. Search debounces 300ms.

Markdown links inside contract/part bodies are intercepted: a slug-shaped href (`titan-tyr`) routes to `/parts/titan-tyr`, a UUID routes to `/contracts/<uuid>`, external (`http://…`) opens in a new tab with a ↗ glyph, anything else is marked broken.

## Where it sits

```

titan-mimiron talks **only** to titan-tyr. The mimiron ↔ tyr contract is registered in titan-tyr (see `GET /parts/titan-mimiron/contracts`).

## Deferred (not in this build)

Tracked in [DESIGN-MVP.md → What's deferred](./DESIGN-MVP.md#whats-deferred): Mermaid graph, environment switcher, sidebar grouped by Part type, git history panel, file-path browsing, contract registration UI, proposal/accept flows, template management UI.

Part registration via `POST /parts` is implemented as a Claude Code skill (`.claude/skills/register-software/`), not a UI form. Run it from Claude Code to add new part nodes.
